                    <h3>Living Walls</h3>
                    <p>Living walls, also known as green walls or vertical gardens, consist of plants grown vertically on a structure attached to a building or a freestanding system. Plants play a vital role in purifying the air by absorbing harmful pollutants and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis.</p>

                    <h3>Rain Gardens</h3>
                    <p>Rain gardens can remove sediments, heavy metals, pathogens, nutrients, hydrocarbons from stormwater via several mechanisms. Various amendments in soil media help in delayed saturation, low sorption capacity, limited pollutant mobility, and bioaccumulation/biotransformation of metals/organic compounds in rain gardens.</p>

                <p>
                    Certainly! Here are three examples of cities that have successfully implemented green infrastructure projects:</p>

                    <p class="caption">1. Portland, Oregon, USA: Portland has implemented a range of green infrastructure projects to manage stormwater runoff and enhance urban biodiversity. These include bioswales, rain gardens, and permeable pavement, which help absorb and filter rainwater, reducing the strain on the city's sewer system and preventing pollution of waterways.</p>

                    <p class="caption">2. ingapore: Despite its limited land area, Singapore has become a global leader in green infrastructure. The city-state has implemented innovative projects such as rooftop gardens, vertical greenery, and extensive tree planting to improve air quality, reduce the urban heat island effect, and enhance urban biodiversity.</p>

                    <p class="caption">3. Copenhagen, Denmark: Copenhagen is renowned for its commitment to sustainability and green living. The city has invested in green infrastructure projects such as bike lanes, green roofs, and sustainable drainage systems. These initiatives not only promote eco-friendly transportation but also help manage stormwater and reduce the city's carbon footprint.</p>
